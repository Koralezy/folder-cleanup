# Folder Cleanup
Folder Cleanup moves files that contain a certain keyword or phrase from one folder to another. You can specify a list of key words and/or phrases, the folder to scan through, and another folder to move the flagged files to!
# How to Use
There should be no requirements. Any version of Python should work, but it was coded in **Python 3.9.10**. Just run the file and follow the directions!
